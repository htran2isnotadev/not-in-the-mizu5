# A Mizu5 death overlay for Not In The Groove (NotITG).

A dumb idea I made when the Mizu5 incident was happening (go to [this video](https://youtu.be/tTGkESKhhkQ) for a summary of this hell of a chaos).

## Installation

Clone this repository and copy the three folders into Simply Love theme's root folder. After that edit Screens/Overlay/Death/default.xml and add `<Layer File="Mizu5" />` inside the ActorFrame dictionary.

Once done and the game boots up fine without errors, simply press 5 in gameplay to change the death overlay.
